TECHNOLOGY USED:  
Python IDE:   Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.

Jupyter Notebook:   The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.   Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more. 

LIBRARY USED: NUMPY, PANDAS 

NUMPY:  NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.   The ancestor of NumPy, Numeric, was originally created by Jim Hugunin with contributions from several other developers.   In 2005, Travis Oliphant created NumPy by incorporating features of the competing Numarray into Numeric, with extensive modifications.   NumPy is open-source software and has many contributors. 

PANDAS:  In computer programming, pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.   In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. It is free software released under the three-clause BSD license.   The name is derived from the term "panel data", an econometrics term for data sets that include observations over multiple time periods for the same individuals.
